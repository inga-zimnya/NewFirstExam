# NewFirstExam
Fixed tasks for the first exam

### Attention!!! 
Folder TaskOne contains files only for the first task, so even after downloading repo you have to open it separately and run separately from folder TaskTwo. 
For this exercise you should run `TaskOne.java` from /TaskOne/scr. 

The same thing applies for the second task as well: after downloading repo you have to open it separately and run separately from folder TaskTwo. 
This solution contains 3 files: `Main.java`, `CactusSchedule.java` and `Sensor.java`. You should run `Main.java` from /TaskTwo/scr.
